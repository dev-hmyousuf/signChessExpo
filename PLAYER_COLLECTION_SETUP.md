# Players Collection Setup Guide

To fix the player registration error ("Collection with the requested ID could not be found"), you need to create the 'players' collection in your Appwrite database:

1. Go to the Appwrite Console: https://cloud.appwrite.io/console
2. Navigate to Databases â†’ Your Database (ID: 681a32370038fa6c72f0)
3. Click "Create Collection"
4. Enter the following information:
   - Collection ID: `681a3287000d8e290f6d` (exactly as shown)
   - Name: "Players"
   - Permissions: Set to match your requirements (recommended: allow public read)

5. After creating the collection, add the following attributes:

### Required Attributes
- `userId` (string, required): Original user ID

### Create Indexes

- Index on `username` (unique)
- Index on `countryId` (non-unique)
- Index on `rating` (non-unique)
